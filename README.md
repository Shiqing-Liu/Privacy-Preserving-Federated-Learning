## Overview

Our project "Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning" received the "Best Project Award" during the Congress of Intelligent Systems in November 2022 by an expert jury. The goal was to investigate the uprising technology of Federated Learning (in which Machine Learning is performed decentralized on edge devices such as mobile phones in connection with a central server) concerning data privacy, computational, and communication efficiency. After a systematical investigation, we combined several high-performing solutions to each problem and created a modular system to mimic real-world scenarios of unstable and unbalanced connectivity. The involved team members were Hela Jemli, Fabian Luca Reichwald, and Louis Scheu. The project was supervised by Prof. Yaochu Jin, Yuping Yan, and Shiqing Liu.
